1. Update the version number in setup.py
1.5 Update the version in hyperopt/__init__.py
2. python setup.py sdist
3. git tag -s <version> # TODO: determine annotated vs. signed [1]
4. git push origin <version>
5. python setup.py sdist upload
7. announce to hyperopt-announce (maybe also scikit-learn?)

# Aug 7 - using vader, I built and uploaded a bdist, but
# when I tried to intall hyperopt from pypi on the mac, it failed to find a
# file in some build directory... deleting the bdist from pypi resulted in a
# successful installation on the mac.
# -> For now, don't upload a bdist.


# [1] Yaroslav Halchenko posted in issue #122 about signed vs. annotated tags
# being good for releases. TODO, decide which to use and how, etc.
