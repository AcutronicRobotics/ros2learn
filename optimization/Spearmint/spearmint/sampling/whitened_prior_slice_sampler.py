#
# Academic and Non-Commercial Research Use Software License and Terms
# of Use
#
# Spearmint is a software package to perform Bayesian optimization
# according to specific algorithms (the “Software”).  The Software is
# designed to automatically run experiments (thus the code name
# 'spearmint') in a manner that iteratively adjusts a number of
# parameters so as to minimize some objective in as few runs as
# possible.
#
# The Software was developed by Ryan P. Adams, Michael Gelbart, and
# Jasper Snoek at Harvard University, Kevin Swersky at the
# University of Toronto (“Toronto”), and Hugo Larochelle at the
# Université de Sherbrooke (“Sherbrooke”), which assigned its rights
# in the Software to Socpra Sciences et Génie
# S.E.C. (“Socpra”). Pursuant to an inter-institutional agreement
# between the parties, it is distributed for free academic and
# non-commercial research use by the President and Fellows of Harvard
# College (“Harvard”).
#
# Using the Software indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms
# of this Software Use Agreement (“Agreement”). Absent your agreement
# to the terms below, you (the “End User”) have no rights to hold or
# use the Software whatsoever.
#
# Harvard agrees to grant hereunder the limited non-exclusive license
# to End User for the use of the Software in the performance of End
# User’s internal, non-commercial research and academic use at End
# User’s academic or not-for-profit research institution
# (“Institution”) on the following terms and conditions:
#
# 1.  NO REDISTRIBUTION. The Software remains the property Harvard,
# Toronto and Socpra, and except as set forth in Section 4, End User
# shall not publish, distribute, or otherwise transfer or make
# available the Software to any other party.
#
# 2.  NO COMMERCIAL USE. End User shall not use the Software for
# commercial purposes and any such use of the Software is expressly
# prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, use of the
# Software in fee-for-service arrangements, core facilities or
# laboratories or to provide research services to (or in collaboration
# with) third parties for a fee, and in industry-sponsored
# collaborative research projects where any commercial rights are
# granted to the sponsor. If End User wishes to use the Software for
# commercial purposes or for any other restricted purpose, End User
# must execute a separate license agreement with Harvard.

#
# 5.  FEEDBACK. In order to improve the Software, comments from End
# Users may be useful. End User agrees to provide Harvard with

# improvements to the Software without compensation or an accounting
# to End User.
#
# 6.  NON ASSERT. End User acknowledges that Harvard, Toronto and/or
