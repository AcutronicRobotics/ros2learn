## Installation

Please refer to [Install.md](/Install.md) to install from sources.

Refer to [docker/README.md](/docker/README.md) for ROS2Learn Docker container installation and usage instructions.

## Usage

### Tune hyperparameters
Check the optimal network hyperparameters for the environment you want to train. [Hyperparams.md](/Hyperparams.md).

### Train an agent
You will find all available examples at */experiments/examples/*. Although the algorithms are complex, the way to execute them is really simple. For instance, if you want to train MARA robot using ppo2_mlp, you should execute the following command:

```sh
cd ~/ros2learn/experiments/examples/MARA
python3 train_ppo2_mlp.py
```

Note that you can add the command line arguments provided by the environment, which in this case are provided by the gym-gazebo2 Env. Use `-h` to get all the available commands.

If you want to test your own trained neural networks, or train with different environment form gym-gazebo2, or play with the hyperparameters, you must update the values of the dictionary directly in the corresponding algorithm itself. For this example, we are using *ppo2_mlp* from [baselines](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/ros2learn/tree/master/algorithms) submodule, so you can edit the `mara_mlp()` function inside [baselines/ppo2/defaults.py](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/baselines/blob/8396ea2dc4d19cabb7478f6c3df0119660f0ab18/baselines/ppo2/defaults.py#L28-L53).

### Run a trained policy
Once you are done with the training, or if you want to test some specific checkpoint of it, you can run that using one of the running-scripts available. This time, to follow with the example, we are going to run a saved ppo2_mlp policy.

First, we will edit the already mentioned `mara_mlp()` dictionary, in particular the `trained_path` value, in [baselines/ppo2/defaults.py](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/baselines/blob/8396ea2dc4d19cabb7478f6c3df0119660f0ab18/baselines/ppo2/defaults.py#L53) to the checkpoint we want (checkpoints placed by default in /tmp/ros2learn). Now we are ready to launch the script.

Since we want to visualize it in real conditions, we are also going to set some flags:

```sh
cd ~/ros2learn/experiments/examples/MARA
python3 run_ppo2_mlp.py -g -r -v 0.3
```

This will launch the simulation with the visual interface, real time physics (no speed up) and 0.3 rad/sec velocity in each servomotor.

### Visualize training data on tensorboard

The logdir path will change according to the used environment ID and the used algorithm in training.
Now you just have to execute Tensorboard and open the link it will provide (or localhost:port_number) in your web browser. You will find many useful graphs like the reward (eprewmean) plotted there.

You can also set a specific port number in case you want to visualize more than one tensorboard file from different paths.

```sh
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/ros2learn/MARACollision-v0/ppo2_mlp --port 8008
```

## Do your own experiment

### Hyperparameter tunning (existing environment)
1. Set the desired target in the corresponding environment in [gym-gazebo2](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/ros2learn/tree/master/environments) submodule.
    - self.target_position
    - self.target_orientation
2. Set the desired hyperparameters in the corresponding default script of the algorithm in [baselines](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/ros2learn/tree/master/algorithms) submodule.

### Create your own train script to use your own environment
1. Create a session
2. Get the hyperparameters from the corresponding defaults script of the algorithm to be used (you will need to add a new dictionary for your own environment)
3. Make the environment
    - DummyVecEnv for a single instance
    - SubprocVecEnv for multiple instances
4. Call the corresponding learn function of the algorithm to be used

Optional:
- Save the statistics and checkpoints in Tensorboard
  - checkpoints
  - tensorboard
  - log
  - monitor
  - progress
- Save the used hyperparameters in the training

:warning: Be aware of `env.set_episode_size(episode_size)` function, if it is not called once the environment is made, the default size of the episode will be 1024. It is advisable to set the same value as the one to be used in the learning algorithm, or at least a power of 2.

### Create your own run script to use your own environment
1. Create a session
2. Get the hyperparameters from the corresponding defaults script of the algorithm in [baselines](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/ros2learn/tree/master/algorithms) submodule used in training time, and also the target in your own environment
    - self.target_position
    - self.target_orientation
3. Make a single environment (DummyVecEnv)
4. Normalize the environment (VecNormalize) if you have normalized in the training
5. Make the model and load the checkpoint you want to test
6. Get the actions from the model
    - stochastic
    - deterministic
7. Execute the actions

Optional:
- Save in files some useful information such us:
  - Accuracy
  - Position error (axes)
  - Orientation error (quaternion)
